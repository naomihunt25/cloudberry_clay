    The Story Behind Cloudberry Clay
  </h2>

  <p class="lead mx-auto text-secondary">
    Cloudberry Clay began as a quiet creative escape, a small corner of the
    world where colour, texture, and imagination could take shape freely. What
    started as a personal love for clay quickly grew into a heartfelt mission:
    to craft pieces that bring warmth, joy, and gentle beauty into everyday
    life.
    <br>
    <br>
    Each item is shaped slowly and thoughtfully by hand. Inspired by soft
    pastels, organic textures, and playful forms, Cloudberry Clay embraces the
    charm of the imperfect and the one-of-a-kind. No two pieces are ever quite
    the same, and that uniqueness is celebrated.
    <br>
    <br>
    From delicate ring holders to expressive vases and calming home decor, every
    creation is made with intention. Whether it becomes part of your morning
    routine, your favourite corner, or a cherished gift, each piece is crafted
    to add a little moment of joy to your day.
    <br>
    <br>
    Cloudberry Clay is more than a collection of handcrafted goods, it is a
    celebration of creativity, gentle living, and the magic found in small
    details. Thank you for supporting handmade craftsmanship and being part of
    this journey.
